The design was modeled in Onshape, and the original document can be found [Here](https://cad.onshape.com/documents/dcaea6dc5199b291bcaaa598/w/66d2cbce5a92038e6d6f67a2/e/40bf932127e5a78ff7f9ca56)

## Printing
I got best results printing with a .2mm layer height. I used a Printrbot Simple Maker with heated bed, with the bed temperature set to 70Â°C. The design is made for a .4mm diameter nozzle so that the walls are each two lines wide. I recommend setting a wall thickness of .8mm to prevent the slicer from doing anything strange with the thin sections

The top-case half is designed so that when printing with a .3mm bottom layer you can switch filament colors between layers to get the text to stand out more. You can do this in Cura using the "Pause at Z height" set to .4mm.
